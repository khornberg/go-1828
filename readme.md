Webster's 1828 Dictionary

CAT, n.
1.  A name applied to certain species of carnivorous quadrupeds, of the genus Felis.  The domestic cat needs no description.  It is a deceitful animal, and when enraged, extremely spiteful.  It is kept in houses, chiefly for the purpose of catching rats and mice.  The wild cat is much larger than the domestic cat.  It is a strong, ferocious animal, living in the forest, and very destructive to poultry and lambs.
The wild cat of Europe is of the same species with the domestic cat; the catamount, of N. America, is much larger and a distinct species.
2.  A ship formed on the Norwegian model, having a narrow stern, projecting quarters, and a deep waist.  It is strong built, from four to six hundred tons burthen, and employed in the coal trade.
3.  A strong tackle or combination of pulleys, to hook and draw an anchor perpendicularly up to the cat-head of a ship.
4.  A double tripod having six feet.
Cat of nine tails, an instrument of punishment, consisting of nine pieces of line or cord fastened to a piece of thick rope, and having three knots at intervals, used to flog offenders on board of ships.
